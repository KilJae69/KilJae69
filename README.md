Hi there üëã, I'm Adi,
**Dedicated Professional Transitioning into Web Development**

**About Me:**

I am a seasoned professional with a wealth of experience in the fields of protection, legal affairs, and crisis management, previously serving in significant roles with UNHCR and Save the Children. 
My journey has been marked by a steadfast dedication to supporting vulnerable populations and navigating complex legal and social landscapes.

However, driven by a desire for intellectual growth and a profession where hard work and skills are directly recognized and rewarded, I have pivoted my career towards web development. 
This shift represents not just a change in profession, but an alignment with my values and aspirations for continuous learning and making a tangible impact through technology.

**üí° Creative Solutions:** Web development offers the ability to craft creative solutions and directly apply my skills in a tangible, impactful way.  
**üåê Global Impact: **The tech industry's global reach provides the opportunity to make a difference on a larger scale.  

**What I'm Focused On:**  

üåê Developing my skills in front-end web technologies.  
üìö Deepening my knowledge in programming languages and frameworks.  
üíº Seeking opportunities where I can blend my rich background with my growing tech skills.  
ü§ù Connecting with professionals and communities in the tech world.  

**My Past Experience:**

**Technical Projects:**  
1.  **Project Name**: Dots Art    

DotsArt.ba is a vibrant and visually captivating website dedicated to showcasing the exquisite and meditative art of mandala dotting. This website presents a unique blend of tradition and creativity, featuring a gallery of handcrafted mandala items meticulously created by my mom. Each piece is a testament to the beauty and precision of this ancient art form, brought to life through her skilled craftsmanship.  

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, DotsArt.ba is not just a platform for displaying these beautiful artworks but also an homage to the intricate techniques of mandala dotting. Visitors are invited to explore the fascinating world of mandalas, each piece narrating its own story through patterns, colors, and textures.  

As the creator of this site and a budding web developer, I plan to continually enhance the website's features and interactivity as I develop my skills further.

**Additional Learning Resources**  
Alongside my formal courses, I've also greatly benefited from several YouTube channels that provided invaluable insights and clarifications on web development topics. 
These channels have been a significant part of my self-study, often helping me overcome hurdles and deepen my understanding.   

**I'd like to highlight**:  
for CSS, Kevin Powell and his youtube channel at https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell helped me incredibly when I finally left the world of tutorial hell and embarked on my first solo project.   
And also Kyle and his channel WebDevSimplified at https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified. His tips and tricks with short and concise explanations really helped to overcome some nuances that I found while learning.

Their teachings have not only imparted technical knowledge but have also inspired me to continuously learn and grow. I am sure that this list will just get bigger with both my new projects and thank you notes, as learning is never ending road.
